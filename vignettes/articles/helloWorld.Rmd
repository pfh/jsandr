**Text editors:** You will need a text editor. Since we're going to be using R, it will be convenient to use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as a text editor. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another currently popular choice. 


# HTML

Using a text editor, put the code below in a file called `hello1.html`. 

```
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hello world</title>
```

Open the file in your web browser. One way to do this is by entering the URL [`file:///`](file:///) in your browser and navigating to the file you created.


# HTML + Javascript

HTML can include code written in Javascript.

Put the code below in a file called `hello2.html`.

```
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Hello world</title>

<div id="output"></div>

<script>
document.getElementById("output").innerText = "Hello world from Javascript!";
</script>
```


# Rmarkdown + Javascript

If your data is most easily accessible via R, you might write an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document containing both R and Javascript code. Any R code runs when the document is knitted. Any Javascript code runs as the resulting HTML file is loaded in your web browser.

Create a file called `hello2.Rmd` and knit it with `rmarkdown::render("hello2.Rmd")`.

# Delay Javascript until document loaded

I like to be able to read and understand a document from top to bottom, so I like to put outputs below the code and inputs that define them.

Also here I introduce a code pattern of writing an [idempotent][1] `update()` function which is called whenever needed to update the outputs. This will help us write correct (but sometimes inefficient) code.
